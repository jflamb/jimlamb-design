            <p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my portfolio. 
                I’m passionate about designing great user experiences, and I love working with talented, diverse teams to bring them to life. 
                I’m currently a Sr. UX Designer for Microsoft working on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/">Azure DevOps</a>. 
                More specifically, I work on developer-facing experiences in the Pipelines, Repos, and Artifacts services.</p>

            <h2>Recent work</h2>

            <p>I’ve been working on a YAML editor for Azure Pipelines based on the Monaco editor component from Visual Studio Code. 
                The way that the editor is virtualized constrains the options for layouts and scrolling behavior, but I was able to come up with a clean, simple solution.</p>

            <p>Another view that posed some interesting challenges was a listing of pipeline runs. 
                There’s a lot of information to convey in this view, particularly for large-scale cases. 
                We ended up going in a somewhat different direction with this design, but this an exploration I designed during the process.</p>

            <p>To support the keynote presentation for Microsoft Build 2019, I iterated on my earlier design for creating a new pipeline. 
                Since deploying to a Kubernetes cluster is a fairly complex process, I came up with a simple way to capture some additional configuration information during the process.</p>

            <p>Of course, some of the work that comes your way isn’t so glamorous. 
                In this case, I was asked to design an experience for protecting branches matching a pattern across a (potentially large) set of Git repositories.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
        
            <p>Before we created our current design system, we were using a framework we had adapted from an early version of Microsoft Fabric. 
                It looks a bit dated by current standards, but it gives you some idea of what I can do even under those kinds of constraints.</p>
